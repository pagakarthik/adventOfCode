# Introduction
- Challenge: Work on the Advent of Code Dec'19 edition
- Started on 15th December

## Current Status
- Each program is a separaye program that can be either executed by itself
--- use command (and inlude inputs if any)`python3 <program.py> <ip1> <ip2>`

## Analysis
Further, in order to analyze the true run time of each program, a standalone program `solver.py` has been created that uses a timer decorator to capture reudimentary run time logs of each day's (part a and b) advents.

In order to run this program, use the following command `solver.py`
Prior to executing the program, uncomment a specific test program of choice from the `main` function.

## Next Steps
The advents are very exciting. In true spirit of competition I have not used/ copied code from any publicly or privately available source code. All work honors Advent code of conduct, and works effectively within reasonable run time.
